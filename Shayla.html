		<p> <font color="white"> It all started after a movie night with my sister and her bestfriend, we entered chipotle and I was a very picky eater back then so the contents of my burrito were very scarceonly containing white rice, black beans, steak, and cheese.</p></div></font>

			<h3><font color="white">Evolution Starts</h3></font>
			<p> <font color="white"> As I continued to get chipotle through the years I slowly but surely started to add more to my burrito.However, only adding two new additions: sour cream. All in all meaing that my burrito was still very small compared to the other people I went to Chipotle with. I was realizing that I was often being picked on for the lack of ingredients in my burrito, so I decided it was time to branch out and began to add corn and lettus. At that moment when I took the first bite I knew I had made the right decision.</font></p></div>
